Modification of the [FactoryIdle](http://factoryidle.com/) game to simulate
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life),
devised by [palparepa](https://www.reddit.com/user/palparepa).

(This proves that FactoryIdle is Turing-complete.)

It is possible to implement the Life cell in the vanilla FactoryIdle,
but due to its size only one fits inside the available factories.
You also need to play the game for a while to get access to some components,
and actually not make any mistakes when copying the complicated design.

So here is the vanilla game, but preloaded with a suitably huge factory
and the cell design. It can, excruciatingly slowly, simulate a glider.
